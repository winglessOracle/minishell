Carien:
 - cc: redirect: Permission denied check right _exit / exit call  
 - exit "leak" in process b after "/bin/ls -la", = cmd not found, normal exit in check_cmd function, should be _exit in child processes 
 - variable _= in environment 
 - env should show vars with = and no value (not just no value) 
 - seg fault with unset first variable!!! 

Carlo:
 - wildcard aan het begin van woord
 - exit codes in exit with large numbers. 
 - signal ctrl-D exit code is now previous exit code, should be 1 
 - signal ctrl-\ should quit a "blocking cmd" like cat or grep or wc
