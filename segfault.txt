/* check Carien */
check cd with CDPATH

/* checks Carlo */
empty redirect nodes should result in error 
readline keeps first characters (solve if persistent history removed)
double here_doc 

ctrl-C should display a new line with a new prompt (check that previous text does not get executed)
ctrl-D in prompt with text should do nothing.
try ctrls with blocking command (eg cat with no arguments) (ctrl-C prints ^C on a new line and exits child, 
ctrl-D exits child and prints nothing, ctrl-/ does nothing)
