/* check Carien */
should none existing var be NULL or ""? Now NULL but this wil stop the cmd execution at that point?
NULL should be skipped in cmd vector? --> echo $var -n aap
make bash script for testing?
check "expr $? + $?"
use PS1 for testing as it has wierd characters...

/* checks Carlo */
readline keeps first characters
redirect can have empty filenames or should expander flag error?
check gettingAR and VAR2
ctrl-C should display a new line with a new prompt (check that previous text does not get executed)
ctrl-D in prompt with text should do nothing.
ctrl-/ does nothing
try ctrls with blocking command (eg cat with no arguments) (ctrl-C prints ^C on a new line and exits child, 
ctrl-D exits child and prints nothing, ctrl-/ does nothing)
PATH directories should be checked from left to right.
