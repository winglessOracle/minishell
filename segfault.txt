env_array should only include type 2
readline keeps first characters
redirect can have empty filenames or should expander flag error?
ctrl-C should display a new line with a new prompt (check that previous text does not get executed)
ctrl-D in prompt with text should do nothing.
ctrl-/ does nothing
try ctrls with blocking command (eg cat with no arguments) (ctrl-C prints ^C on a new line and exits child, 
ctrl-D exits child and prints nothing, ctrl-/ does nothing)
