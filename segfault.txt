/* Segfaults or incorrect behaviour */
empty quotes should produce empty string in node
------------------------

/* check Carien */
leaks
remove prev uit token nodes?
make bash script for testing?
spatie na expanded command met spaties moet wel weg?? eerst testen met executer (bijvoorbeeld $PS1)
check "expr $? + $?"

/* checks Carlo */
redirect can have empty filenames or should expander flag error?
check gettingAR and VAR2
ctrl-C should display a new line with a new prompt (check that previous text does not get executed)
ctrl-D in prompt with text should do nothing.
ctrl-/ does nothing
try ctrls with blocking command (eg cat with no arguments) (ctrl-C prints ^C on a new line and exits child, 
ctrl-D exits child and prints nothing, ctrl-/ does nothing)
PATH directories should be checked from left to right.
