command | another $command |
#comment
< input for command 1 | << here for heredoc > out | >> append the last
< $var 
< "$var" 
< '$var'

/* Segfaults or incorrect behaviour */
< "in" > "out"
$PS1
< "input with var $PS1" for command 1 | << "here with var $PWD" for heredoc > out | >> append the last

------------------------

/* todo */
cleanup pipe whem | at end of line
blank in redirect after quotes sequence (same as space after expanded command with space?)
spatie na expanded command met spaties moet wel weg?? eerst testen met executer
cleanup empty command or does the executer check that?
check getting vars with overlapping name for example VAR and VAR2
remove prev uit token nodes?
make bash script for testing?
