cd has leaks
echo ~ does not work

/* check Carien */
update shel level


/* checks Carlo */
empty redirect nodes should result in error 
readline keeps first characters (solve if persistent history removed)

redirect test for several  out files still hase race issues. : < Makefile cat > tester/output/out1 > tester/output/out2 > tester/output/out3 | cat tester/output/out3

sigint from sleep or cat etc  displays extra prompt

exit 42 bala should not exit shell (too many arguments)
