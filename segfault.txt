/* Working correctly */

hello world 'does | this work?' hello=10 $PWD word | word "#comment not gone" | with $PS1 and #comment that will be gone 
| followed by command
|
command | another $command |
#comment
< input for command 1 | << here for heredoc > out | >> append the last
< $var 
< "$var" 
< '$var' 
<< $var 
<< "$var" 
<< '$var'


/* Segfaults or incorrect behaviour */
$PS1
< "in" > "out"
< "input with var $PS1" for command 1 | << "here with var $PWD" for heredoc > out | >> append the last

------------------------

/* todo */
blank in redirect after quotes sequence (same as space after expanded command with space?)
cleanup at error (check on empty command if only #comment tokens)
check getting vars with overlapping name for example VAR and VAR2
spatie na expanded command met spaties moet wel weg?? eerst testen met executer
remove prev uit token nodes?
make bash script for testing?
