Signal handling: Ensure that you are handling signals properly in your shell program. 
If a child process is terminated with SIGTERM, the signal might be received by the parent process as well.
Make sure you handle the SIGTERM signal in the parent process and perform any necessary cleanup or termination.

File descriptor handling: If your child processes are manipulating file descriptors or opening files, there might be issues with how you handle them. Ensure that you are properly closing file descriptors and using them as intended.
